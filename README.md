# Evidence-Based Strength Training App

A web application that generates personalized strength training workouts based on the scientific recommendations of Milo Wolf, Dr. Pak Androulakis-Korakakis, and Jeff Nippard.

## Features

- **Personalized Workouts**: Generate workouts based on your experience level, time availability, and training goals
- **Evidence-Based Programming**: Incorporates proven principles from leading strength and conditioning researchers
- **Multiple Training Styles**: 
  - Strength-focused training
  - Hypertrophy (muscle building) training  
  - Powerlifting-specific training
- **Adaptive Duration**: Workouts for 30, 45, 60, or 90 minutes
- **Experience-Appropriate**: Different programming for beginners, intermediates, and advanced trainees

## Training Principles Incorporated

### From Stronger By Science (Greg Nuckols, Milo Wolf, Dr. Pak)
- **Progressive Overload**: The fundamental driver of strength and muscle gains
- **Volume Landmarks**: 10-20 sets per muscle group per week for hypertrophy
- **Intensity Zones**: Appropriate load percentages for different goals
- **Recovery Guidelines**: Evidence-based rest periods between sets

### From Jeff Nippard
- **Compound Movement Focus**: Emphasis on multi-joint exercises
- **Rep Range Periodization**: Varied rep ranges for different adaptations
- **Movement Quality**: Proper form cues and technique notes

## How to Use

1. **Select Workout Duration**: Choose from 30, 45, 60, or 90 minutes
2. **Choose Experience Level**: Beginner (0-1 year), Intermediate (1-3 years), or Advanced (3+ years)
3. **Pick Your Goal**: Strength focus, muscle building, or powerlifting
4. **Generate Workout**: Get a customized workout with exercise details

## Training Guidelines

### Beginner (0-1 year)
- Focus on movement quality and consistency
- Progressive overload through adding weight weekly
- Higher rep ranges for skill development
- Emphasis on compound movements

### Intermediate (1-3 years)
- Higher volume for muscle growth
- Train each movement pattern 2-3x per week
- Volume-focused approach with moderate intensity
- Introduction of more exercise variation

### Advanced (3+ years)
- Periodized approach with intensity variations
- Focus on addressing weak points
- Competition-specific training for powerlifters
- Advanced exercise selection and programming

## Exercise Database

The app includes:
- **Compound Exercises**: Squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, rows, pull-ups
- **Accessory Exercises**: Targeted movements for muscle development and injury prevention
- **Form Cues**: Evidence-based technique notes for each exercise

## Scientific Basis

This app is based on peer-reviewed research and recommendations from:
- Stronger By Science research reviews
- Meta-analyses on training volume and intensity
- Periodization research for strength sports
- Biomechanics studies for exercise selection

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to start using the app. No installation or server setup required.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Workout tracking and progression
